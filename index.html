<h2>Rodney:</h2>
<p>Thank you for being the best husband and father. I wish we could spend the day together, but I hope you know how much you mean to me. I don't know what I would do without you. I want to thank you for always being there for me, even on the days that it's hard. I want to thank you for choosing me over and over again. And I want to thank you for always believing in me and my dreams, even when I don't believe in myself. I can't wait to see the world with you and to spend forever together.</p>

<h1>We love you so much and Happy Father's Day!</h1> <br />
<h1>Love,</h1>
